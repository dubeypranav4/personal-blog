I’ve been using AeroSpace—an i3-style tiling window manager for macOS—for the past few months, and I’ve really grown to like it. At this point, I’ve more or less stopped using the native macOS window/workspace switcher and rely on AeroSpace entirely.
Side note: the project is still in public beta, so a few breaking changes are to be expected until it hits 1.0.

For my setup, I’ve got AeroSpace with ctrl + alt as the leader key combo, and I use Karabiner Elements to remap caps lock (which I never touch anyway) to ctrl + alt. Pretty neat little workflow.
